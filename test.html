      <p class="info"> It is important after learning new things to test yourself if you have really learned something from what we just read. We believe that it is not enough to review and read the writings over and over again, and that experiences are better rather than just simple writing. Of course, we can't seek for such circumstances to happen, rather it is something we should wait for. So for now, we have listed below a list of stories you may follow to test your knowledge regarding the three papal documents: Laudato Si, Gaudete Exsultate, and Christus Vivit. Choose among them which story you would want to experience!</p>
